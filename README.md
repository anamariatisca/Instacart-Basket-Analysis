# Instacart-Grocery-Basket-Analysis

This Python project was part of CareerFoundry's Data Analytics course in which I 
analyzed Instacart's Grocery Basket data to identify sales patterns.

## Objective

Instacart is an online grocery store that operates through an app. Instacart already has very good sales, 
but they want to uncover more information about their sales patterns. 
My task was to perform an initial data and exploratory analysis of some of their data in order to derive 
insights and suggest strategies for better segmentation based on the provided criteria.

## Context 

The Instacart stakeholders were most interested in the variety of customers in their database along with their purchasing behaviors. They assumed they can't target everyone using the same methods, and they considered a targeted marketing strategy. They wanted to target different customers with applicable marketing campaigns to see whether they have an effect on the sale of their products. The analysis will inform what this strategy might look like to ensure Instacart targets the right customer profiles with the appropriate products.

## Key Questions

<ul><li>The sales team needs to know what the busiest days of the week and hours of the day are (i.e., the days and times with the most orders) in order to schedule ads at times when there are fewer orders.</li></ul>
<ul><li>They also want to know whether there are particular times of the day when people spend the most money, as this might inform the type of products they advertise at these times.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Instacart has a lot of products with different price tags. Marketing and sales want to use simpler price range groupings to help direct their efforts.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Are there certain types of products that are more popular than others? The marketing and sales teams want to know which departments have the highest frequency of product orders.</li></ul>
<ul><li>The marketing and sales teams are particularly interested in the different types of customers in their system and how their ordering behaviors differ. For example:
</li></ul>
    <ul><li>What’s the distribution among users in regards to their brand loyalty (i.e.,   how often do they return to Instacart)?</li></ul>
    <ul><li>Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customer’s loyalty status?</li></ul>
    <ul><li>Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customer’s region?
</li></ul>
<ul><li>Is there a connection between age and family status in terms of ordering
habits?</li></ul>
<ul><li>What different classifications does the demographic information suggest?
Age? Income? Certain types of goods? Family status?</li></ul>
<ul><li>What differences can you find in ordering habits of different customer
profiles? Consider the price of orders, the frequency of orders, the products customers are ordering, and anything else you can think of.
</li></ul>
