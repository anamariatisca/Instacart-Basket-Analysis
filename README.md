# Instacart-Grocery-Basket-Analysis

This Python project was part of CareerFoundry's Data Analytics course in which I 
analyzed Instacart's Grocery Basket data to identify sales patterns.

## Objective

Instacart is an online grocery store that operates through an app. Instacart already has very good sales, 
but they want to uncover more information about their sales patterns. 
My task was to perform an initial data and exploratory analysis of some of their data in order to derive 
insights and suggest strategies for better segmentation based on the provided criteria.

## Context 

The Instacart stakeholders were most interested in the variety of customers in their database along with their purchasing behaviors. They assumed they can't target everyone using the same methods, and they considered a targeted marketing strategy. They wanted to target different customers with applicable marketing campaigns to see whether they have an effect on the sale of their products. The analysis will inform what this strategy might look like to ensure Instacart targets the right customer profiles with the appropriate products.
