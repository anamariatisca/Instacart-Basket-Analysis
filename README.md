## Objective

Instacart is an online grocery store that operates through an app. Instacart already has very good sales, 
but they want to uncover more information about their sales patterns. 
My task was to perform an initial data and exploratory analysis of some of their data in order to derive 
insights and suggest strategies for better segmentation based on the provided criteria.
